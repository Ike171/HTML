    <h2>Isaac Frankman</h2>
    <h2>Ike</h2>
    <p>I am 21 and recently married to my eternal companion. She is the best! I am studying software engineering and love the flexibility that would bring. Almost every field needs software engineers or at least some computer science so I figure I can study software engineering and then specialize a bit more when I learn what I want to really dive into. I love playing sports ecspecially basketball and football though I will play almost any sport. (no gurentee I will be good though ;) I've been a memboer of the church my whole life and I think one of my favorite quotes is by President Monson he said, "Work without vision is drudgery. Vision without work is dreaming. Work coupled with vision is destiny.</p>
