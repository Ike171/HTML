      <h3>Info/ Selling Points</h3>
      <p>
        Pre-summary of selling point
        People will come to this site to buy the best fishing line available to them. Fishermen never want to loose a fish, and they prioritise having that line in the water for as long as possible. Having to detangle and always fix or retie your line can be a huge drain of time. Most fisherman will pay an extra couple bucks to save time while out fishing. They will trade a couple bucks anyday for a longer time fishing.
        Logical Point
        I may say on the website, â€œAll good fisherman know that the longer their line is in the water the better chance they have to catch a fish, countless inventions have been made to help us speed the process of fishing. A long time ago people used vine and bone to fish. While that works its not nearly effecive as where we are at now. Inventions such as the rod the reel and hook have all been made in an effort to speed the process of fishing up and help us not to loose the fish we are so seeking after. This line is one of those tools you can use to keep your line in the water longer to not have to loose the fish you have been searching all day for.
        Summary of Selling points
        They will want to complete the activity of buying fishing line or researching more about this type of fishing line. I think as people learn about the benefits and concepts of this product it will naturally sell itself. So visitors will want to be informed if they are visiting the site because obviously if they arrived at the site they would be at least curious about why this page is here or what this fishing line advantages are.

      <h3>Q&A</h3>
      <p>
        Predetermined answered 
        I expect that my page will answer the question of what this fishing line is? Does a different line really make a difference? Yes the fishing line really does make a difference, because of the way the line is twisted while it is being made it is several times stronger than a normal line. Also because the line has already been used (to stretch it) the chord will not tangle it self nearly so often. How expensive is the line? How much line comes included. Why is this fishing line more expensive than other kinds of fishing line? How much weight can it hold. Are there any guarantees included with this fishing line. How long will this line last. Is it worth it?
        Text Box Questions
        If I am feeling confident in my abilities I might even create a text box where they can ask me a question that gets sent to a text file I have access to or even to and email account I will have set up for the purpose.

      <h3>Buying</h3>
      <p>
        Summary of why they are buying to help them go through with the purchase
        The necessary information from me is a bit about what I covered about the quality of the product and why it is useful. I will need a lot of text boxes and simple pictures to help us convey why this fishing line is worth buying.
        Simpleness
        They will come to this site because of the simpleness of the website. Not only will the desihn be sleek and stylish but with the actually content of the page there will be no beating around the bush. Just being straight up with its advantages and disadvantages. The product is superior for the price asked so I can and will be 100% honest about it.
        Buyer Purchase Info
        If I was to set up payment methods I would need to make sure they are secure. I would create a shopping cart feature similar to ones I have programmed in other classes. I would Create several different purchase methods for people in different situations including Visa, Discover, Venmo, Paypal, and Zelle.
