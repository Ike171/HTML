        <h2>Why this line vs straight line</h2>
        <p>This is a great question. Why spend more money if nothing is diffrent. Does this really help or is this just another one of those money grab crappy equipment things you see on instagram and tv all the time. Essetially this line is better because of its twisted nature. We start with highquality line in the first place. The best of the best line, then we twist it a certain precise ammount of times to increase the strength exponetially. Not only does that increase the strength but it takes the memory out of the line.</p>

        <h2>Is this the same as braided line?</h2>
        <p>No this is not the same as braided line although we will be selling that as well. Each has their strong points but some of the major diffrences are that twisted fishing lines memory is far less because each line has already been handles and stretched. Its like the use and ease of a used fishing line minus the damage that catching fish and the line rubbing agasit rocks and bushes cause. </p>

        <h2>How Do I Buy It?</h2>
        <p>After reading through the website people often and understandably want to buy the line. They acknowledge the help and can give to there fishing. Right now the line is in preproduction. This page has two functions 1. teach others the benifits of twisted fishing line and 2. asess how much intrest there would be in this product so we know how much line to order and make.</p>
