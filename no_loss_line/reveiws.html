        <h2>AJ Frankman from Rexburg Idaho</h2>
        <p>When I was little my dad would take me fishing but it wasnt until I was about 21 that I really started to love fishing and leran what it took to be a cathcer more than a fisher. I hate the feeling that comes when loosing a fish due to a damaged line, but that sometimes happens and I understand that and could maybe deal with it with the other lines I use. What really bothered me was knowing I couldnt catch a fish while my line was tangled. With this new line The tangles are non exsistent and I have my line in the water more.</p>

        <p>I will honestly admit I was skeptical that just a simple line could make a diffrence in my fishing sucsess. And its not like it doubled my catching production but it is substantial enough That I noticed the diffrence. I notice I am catching more fish and for those who fish alot you know that doesnt happen very often. To change a peice of equipment (thats not the bait or fly) and see an immediate change in sucsess.</p>
